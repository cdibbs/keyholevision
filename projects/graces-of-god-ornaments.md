Thank you for supporting our shop. We're glad you've chosen to create
collaborative art with us!

## Instructions

For convenience, each of the artworks were placed in their own file. Each file
contains the three to four, ~4in (~100mm) diameter layers comprising that artwork.
The layers were designed to be cut out of 2mm thick plywood but could potentially
work with other thicknesses.

Red lines in the files mean "cut this" while blue lines mean "engrave." Depending
on your software, you may need to load the red first, run that, and then load the
blue while being mindful of relative position. With the open source [LaserGRBL]
software, you can load the file to engrave, "append" the file to cut,
and run the result.

A note on `outside-the-gate.svg`: the base star was meant to be engraved and cut
and then (unlike the other pieces) flipped over before assembly so the text is on the
back of the piece.

Optional, if epoxying:

- Epoxy resin (non-VOC): [https://amzn.to/30xsgmu](https://amzn.to/30xsgmu)

* My epoxy kit came with super thin plastic gloves that tore easily so I got some nitrile gloves instead.
** The fume mask may not be necessary with non-VOC epoxy but I was working indoors so I got it just in case.

## Hints, tips, and ideas

### Staining

The pieces photographed for the shop were stained with food coloring rather than
woodstain. The results were both pleasing and unexpected. If you want to achieve the same
effect, here was what I did.

I used Wilton Icing Colors found here: https://www.amazon.com/Wilton-Icing-Colors-12-Count-Gel-Based/dp/B0000CFN0Y
I put about an 1/8 tsp in a small, ziplock bag with 1/4 cup of water and soaked the wood
panels for about 15 minutes or until the colors looked right. This is a great
place to experiment with wood scraps and find a color scheme you like.

Back panel: Black. This absorbed as a night sky, royal purple and left the remaining water somewhat bluish.

Middle panel: Brown. This gave the appearance of a darker wood.

Middle panel #2 (when present): Golden Yellow.

Front panel: no color / natural wood.

Otherwise, you can experiment with ordinary woodstains or even paint to create
your own effect!

### Final touches - Epoxy

After the pieces are stained and glued together, you can coat them with clear epoxy resin
to give a nice, shiny look which protects them from stains and other damage.

### Final touches - Hanging

After the pieces were stained and glued together, I hot-glued some fishing line to the
backs of the pieces in order to hang them more easily on the Christmas tree. Of course,
there are many ways to accomplish this, but I personally prefer fishing line
because it doesn't intrude on the piece; it's part of the reason why I left a wooden
loop or hanger out of the design.


## Description

This is the "Graces of God" collection. Each is based on a story from the Bible
and in each one, Jesus can be found (some more obvious than others).

1. `sandals-and-gentle-fire.svg`
Flowers may be the most delicate part of a bush. Yet here they are unburnt by
the one who would do no harm. Exodus 3:14-15.

2. `bread-and-grain-multiplied.svg`
10 + 10 loaves of barley bread and some grain fed 10 * 10 people. The piece
depicts the leftovers. 2 Kings 4:42-44.

3. `manna-and-quail-from-heaven.svg`
God fed with honey bread from Heaven by morning and quail by twilight. Exodus 16:11-12.


4. `land-of-milk-and-honey.svg`
What was promised was delivered. Even a whole land. Milk was drawn from
sheep and other non-cows. :-) Jeremiah 32:22.

5. `outside-the-gate.svg`
So rarely is Jesus where we expect him to be. Depicted is Jesus sitting on a
small hill outside of the Lion's Gate of Jerusalem. Hebrews 13:12-14
