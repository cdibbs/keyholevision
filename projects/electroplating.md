# Bright and safe hobbyist electroplating

This is for all those who are rightly a little timid around sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and proprietary/"unknown" brightener formulas
whose material safety data sheets (MSDSs) list "unknown" or worse in terms of health effects and ingredients.
Whether donning personal protective equipment (PPE) or not, these substances can make you feel a little uncomfortable when all you need is
to make some art!

Here are the intended uses of this formula:

 - electroplating your graphite-coated 3D print,
 - electrotyping inside a graphite-coated mold,
 - electroforming jewelry and other items.

This page may not be for those with more technical needs where the speed of deposition matters, or the ductility, strength, adherence, or conductive
properties of the metal matter.

So, here are untested uses of this formula:

 - industrial electroplating (speed is likely slower, but it is still fast enough for forming and typing),
 - hobbyist electroplating of homemade bullets (I hear that adherence, strength, and deposit uniformity are big issues),
 - hobbyist plating of circuit boards (conductivity is untested).

To my knowledge, no studies have been done on the material properties of the deposits resulting from this formula.
I can only tell you what my eyes see: the deposits are beautiful and bright, and at least lack any brittleness, inadherence, or excessive pliability
at a level that would compromise the typical artwork. In other words, when electroformed or typed to a substantial thickness, the resulting copper
deposit feels like it is as pliable as you would expect. And, again, it is beautiful. :)
