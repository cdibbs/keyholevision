Artwork: "Box with Mandala"

## Description

This is a simple wooden box with a mandala design on the top. It's designed to store
jewelry and small items, or to serve as a gift box with a genuine and homemade feel.

## Instructions

A text version of this document is included as a readme in your .zip download.

The box was designed to be cut from 2mm (0.08 in) thick plywood that has dimensions of
at least 12 inch x 6 inch area (300mm x 150mm) or larger). It will not work with other
thicknesses since the joints require foreknowledge of this. That said, it wouldn't be
too challenging to modify the design for 1.5mm - 3mm thick craft plywood.

Red lines in the files mean "cut this" while blue lines mean "engrave." Depending on
your software, you may need to load the blue first, run that, and then load the red
while being mindful of relative position.

For convenience, cut-only and engrave-only versions, so named, exist where needed.

## Assembly

I've found that glue is not strictly required for this build. Nevertheless, for added
strength you may choose to add it with the following recommended steps:

1. (Optional) Assemble the box entirely to make sure it fits together and there were no errors
   during the cutting process.
   - Begin by wrapping the sides around the base.
   - Carefully join the sides together in the back by pressing firmly.
   - Attach the stopper for the lid by carefully pressing the small pegs into the four holes.
     The sides of the box will flex as a result of the "living hinges" at the corners of the box.
   - Attach the lid by gently sliding the two tabs into place, again relying on the flexing of the "living hinges."
2. If you still wish to add glue, begin by carefully disassembling the box if assembled in step #1.
3. Beginning with the bottom, add wood glue all around the edge as well as on the tops and bottoms of the teeth.
4. Press the sides of the box together over the teeth.
5. Wipe off any excess glue.
6. Add glue to the teeth in the back of the box and carefully fit them together.
7. Wipe off any excess glue from the back side of the box, inside and out.
8. Glue the side of the stopper with the four teeth and press into place.
9. Wipe off any excess glue from the stopper, inside and outside of the box.
10. Wait until the glue dries then add the lid.
